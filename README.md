# Smart Digital Lock System (VHDL)

Smart Digital Lock System implemented using VHDL on an FPGA. It uses a 4×4 keypad for password input, 7-segment displays for feedback, and includes password verification, wrong-attempt alerts, and a master reset feature. The design demonstrates FSM-based control, keypad scanning, and digital security logic.

## Features
- 4-digit password logic
- Keypad scanning module
- 7-segment display driver
- Wrong-attempt alert
- Master reset
- FSM-based control

## Repository Structure
- README.md (Project Overview)

You can add VHDL files, testbench, and constraints as needed.
